Create a `git` commit.

The body of the commit should only briefly summarize the code, but extensively explain
the context or the "why" of the change. The best context for the message is what's available
in the chat history with User but unavailable in the code. Think of the body as a way of helping
a future you make rapid impact on the codebase.
