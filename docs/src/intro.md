# Introduction

**cmux** (Coding Agent Multiplexer) is a cross-platform desktop application for AI-assisted development with git worktree integration.

## What is cmux?

cmux helps you work with AI coding assistants more effectively by:

- ðŸ”€ **Git Worktree Integration** - Work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching contexts
- ðŸ¤– **Multiple Permission Modes** - Control how aggressively the AI can modify your code (plan/edit/yolo)
- ðŸ“¦ **Project Management** - Organize and switch between multiple projects seamlessly
- ðŸ’¬ **Session History** - Full chat history persistence across sessions
- ðŸ”„ **Flexible Workflows** - Support for different AI models and providers

## Why cmux?

Traditional AI coding assistants require constant context switching between branches and can be disruptive to existing workflows. cmux solves this by leveraging git worktrees, allowing you to:

- Keep multiple feature branches active simultaneously
- Isolate AI experiments from your main codebase
- Maintain separate chat contexts for different tasks
- Quickly switch between different AI models and configurations
