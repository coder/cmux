## Models

- [System Prompt](./system-prompt.md)

Currently we support the Sonnet 4 models and GPT-5 family of models:

- `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5`
- `anthropic:claude-opus-4-1`
- `openai:gpt-5`
- `openai:gpt-5-pro`
- `openai:gpt-5-codex`

And we intend to always support the models used by 90% of the community.

Anthropic models are better supported than GPT-5 class models due to an outstanding issue in the
Vercel AI SDK.

TODO: add issue link here.
