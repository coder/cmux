# Vim Mode Implementation - Work Summary

## Completed Work

### Test Infrastructure Rewrite
**Goal**: Replace isolated utility function tests with integration tests that verify complete Vim command workflows.

**Problem with Previous Tests**:
- Only tested utility functions in isolation
- Missed integration bugs between component and utilities
- Didn't verify cursor positioning in UI context
- Couldn't catch workflow bugs (e.g., ESC → d$ sequence failing)

**New Test Architecture**:
```typescript
interface VimState {
  text: string;
  cursor: number;
  mode: VimMode;
  yankBuffer: string;
  desiredColumn: number | null;
}

// Simulates complete key sequences
function executeVimCommands(initial: VimState, keys: string[]): VimState

// Tests format: initial state → key sequence → assert final state
test("d$ deletes to end of line", () => {
  const state = executeVimCommands(
    { text: "hello world", cursor: 6, mode: "normal", ... },
    ["d", "$"]
  );
  expect(state.text).toBe("hello ");
  expect(state.cursor).toBe(6);
});
```

**Test Coverage** (34 tests, all passing):
- **Mode Transitions**: ESC, i/a/I/A/o/O entry points
- **Navigation**: h/j/k/l, w/b, 0/$
- **Simple Edits**: x, p/P
- **Line Operations**: dd, yy, cc
- **Operator + Motion**: d$/d0/dw/db, c$/c0/cw, y$/y0/yw
- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step command sequences
- **Edge Cases**: Empty lines, end of text, boundary conditions

**Benefits**:
- Catches integration bugs that unit tests missed
- Self-documenting - shows actual Vim command behavior
- Easier to add new test cases
- Tests user-facing behavior, not implementation details

### Key Fixes Validated by New Tests

1. **$ Motion Cursor Visibility** ✓
   - Bug: Cursor disappeared when pressing $
   - Fix: Changed to return last character position, not past it
   - Test: "$ moves to end of line" validates correct positioning

2. **d$ and c$ Not Working** ✓
   - Bug: ESC → d$ sequence didn't delete anything
   - Root cause: Cursor clamping during mode transition
   - Fix: Clamp cursor when entering normal mode
   - Tests: "ESC then d$ deletes from insert cursor to end"

3. **Operator-Motion Range Calculation** ✓
   - Bug: dw was deleting one character too many
   - Fix: Corrected range boundaries (exclusive end)
   - Tests: All operator+motion tests now pass

## Current Branch Status

## Vim Features Implemented

### Modes
- Insert mode (default)
- Normal mode (ESC / Ctrl-[)
- Mode indicator above textarea

### Navigation (Normal Mode)
- `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` - character and line movement
- `w`/`W` - word forward
- `b`/`B` - word backward
- `0`/`Home` - line start
- `$`/`End` - line end (cursor on last char)
- Column preservation on vertical movement

### Editing (Normal Mode)
- `x` - delete character
- `u` - undo
- `Ctrl-r` - redo
- `p` - paste after
- `P` - paste before

### Composable Operator-Motion System
**Operators**: `d` (delete), `c` (change), `y` (yank)
**Motions**: `w`, `b`, `$`, `0`, doubled for line
**Text Objects**: `iw` (inner word)

All operators work with all motions:
- `dd`, `cc`, `yy` - operate on line
- `dw`, `cw`, `yw` - operate to word
- `d$`, `c$`, `y$` - operate to end of line
- `d0`, `c0`, `y0` - operate to beginning of line
- `diw`, `ciw`, `yiw` - operate on inner word

**Shortcuts**:
- `D` - delete to end of line (same as d$)
- `C` - change to end of line (same as c$)

### Insert Entry
- `i` - insert at cursor
- `a` - append after cursor
- `I` - insert at line start
- `A` - append at line end
- `o` - open line below
- `O` - open line above

### Cursor Behavior
- Solid block in normal mode (no blinking)
- Visible even on empty text
- Always positioned ON a character, never past end
- Properly transitions from insert mode

## Files Modified

- `src/utils/vim.test.ts` - Complete rewrite (626 insertions, 287 deletions)
  - Changed from unit tests to integration tests
  - 34 tests covering complete command workflows
  - Test harness simulates full key sequences

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **More motions**: `e`, `ge`, `f{char}`, `t{char}` (easy - automatically work with all operators)
2. **More text objects**: `i"`, `i'`, `i(`, `i[`, `i{` (easy - automatically work with all operators)
3. **Counts**: `2w`, `3dd`, `5x` (needs count accumulator)
4. **Line-wise paste**: Distinguish line vs character yanks for `p`/`P`
5. **Visual mode**: Character, line, block selection

### Robustness Improvements
1. Replace `execCommand` undo/redo with controlled history
2. IME/composition event handling
3. More edge case tests
4. E2E tests for full user interactions

## Performance Notes

- Tests run in ~8-20ms (34 tests)
- No performance issues identified
- Test harness is lightweight and fast

## Documentation

- Test file is self-documenting with clear test names
- Each test includes comments explaining the workflow
- `VimTextArea.md` contains high-level design documentation
- Inline comments explain complex logic
