/**
 * Unified workspace metadata type used throughout the application.
 * This is the single source of truth for workspace information.
 *
 * ID vs Name:
 * - `id`: Stable unique identifier (10 hex chars for new workspaces, legacy format for old)
 *   Generated once at creation, never changes
 * - `name`: User-facing mutable name (e.g., "feature-branch")
 *   Can be changed via rename operation
 *
 * For legacy workspaces created before stable IDs:
 * - id and name are the same (e.g., "cmux-stable-ids")
 * For new workspaces:
 * - id is a random 10 hex char string (e.g., "a1b2c3d4e5")
 * - name is the branch/workspace name (e.g., "feature-branch")
 *
 * Path handling:
 * - Worktree paths are computed on-demand via config.getWorkspacePath(projectPath, name)
 * - Directory name uses workspace.name (the branch name)
 * - This avoids storing redundant derived data
