# PR #38 Status Report

## Current State
- **Branch**: `storybook-tool-messages`
- **PR**: https://github.com/coder/cmux/pull/38
- **Status**: BLOCKED - Chromatic build failing

## What Works ✅
- ✅ Storybook builds locally
- ✅ All 13 tool message stories render correctly
- ✅ FileReadToolCall custom component working
- ✅ TypeScript/ESLint passing
- ✅ No code quality issues

## What's Blocked ❌
- ❌ Chromatic visual regression testing
- Reason: `@emotion/styled` module resolution failure in Chromatic environment
- Error: `TypeError: a is not a function` (styled is not a function)

## Investigation Summary
Spent significant time investigating the Chromatic build failure:
- Converted 2 components to CSS modules (BashToolCall, FileReadToolCall)
- Tried multiple Vite/Babel configurations
- Added dedupe config for emotion packages
- None resolved the Chromatic-specific issue

## Root Cause
The `@emotion/styled` default export becomes undefined in Chromatic's production build environment. This affects 25+ components across the codebase, not just the new Storybook stories.

## Decision Needed
See `CHROMATIC_ISSUE_SUMMARY.md` for detailed options analysis.

**Quick options:**
1. **Merge as-is** - Storybook works locally, accept Chromatic failure for now
2. **Disable Chromatic** - Remove workflow temporarily, re-enable after fix
3. **Continue conversion** - Convert all 25+ components to CSS modules (10-20 hours)
4. **Open support ticket** - Contact Chromatic team for help

## Recommendation
**Option 1 or 2** - The Storybook feature is complete and working. The Chromatic issue is environmental and affects the entire codebase, not specific to this PR. It should be addressed separately.

The stories provide value for local development even without Chromatic visual regression testing.
