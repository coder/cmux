### Documentation Style Guide

When writing user-facing documentation, follow these principles:

**Minimum Viable Documentation** - Write only what users need to complete their task successfully. Assume users are:

- Capable of using basic UIs without instruction
- Able to debug issues without pre-written troubleshooting
- Smart enough to apply security best practices without being told

**Delete:**

- Step-by-step UI walkthroughs for obvious interactions ("Click the button", "Enter the value", "Click Save")
- Troubleshooting sections for hypothetical problems that haven't occurred
- Best practices and security advice (users will research when needed)
- Multiple ways to do the same thing (pick one, preferably the simplest)
- Verification/testing sections

**Keep:**

- Core setup steps with technical details
- Non-obvious facts about how things work
- Actual command examples
- Brief, clear explanations
